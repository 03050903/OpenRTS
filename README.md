# What is OpenRTS ?
OpenRTS is a 3D real-time strategy game engine coded in java 1.7, powered by jMonkeyEngine 3 and open-source.

OpenRTS intend to support any kind of common real-time strategy gameplay, design and control, provinding it's own editor and a versatile data structure.

The project also wants to be a pool of RTS ressources, giving access to a large and free-to-use set of maps, models, sounds, armies data and gameplays.

But OpenRTS is under developpement. There is a long way to go and a huge and growing TODO list. We will be glad to receive any of your contributions !

# How to set up ?
Just clone the repository into Eclipse and run ! The engine is set by defaut with a test dataset and some exemple maps you can load.

- **F1** : Editor Mode
- **F2** : Game Mode (static iso camera)
- **F3** : First Person view (for testing purpose)

# How to contribute ?

### GitHub issues
We've got a gazillion of issues you can work on right now, and we will be happy to add your requested features to the list. 

### Ressources
OpenRTS wants to provide it's own complete and workable dataset to allow immediate RTS creation.

We are glad to welcome all your creations : models, sounds, maps, particle sprites, army data... And if your contribution respects the current lowpoly art style, it's only better !
